# get stocks

The notebook script 'getStockHistoricalValuesWithSelenium.ipynb' is a script made to get the historical value of stocks/REITs/FIIs, getting these values on the website http://investing.com/.
To get these informations had a few difficulties like pop-ups appearing in random hours, many times, accept the cookies of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), fill dates fields etc.

# Study of FIIs

The notebook script 'study of FIIs.ipynb' is a script made to get informations about FIIs.
The FII is like a REIT in Brazil and I got informations like P/PV(price/patrimonial value), type of FII, dividend yield etc. The difficulties are, for example, put login and password, 
popups, and get the full table rather than of download a .csv with values.
